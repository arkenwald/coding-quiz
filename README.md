Description

This project is for self-improvement and practice in order to provide myself with confidence within this industry.

A Random Password Generator was created using Javascript.

This challenge provided me with the skills to use functions within JavaScript to have the end-user interact with the web application as intended.

Installation

To install the project, I've initiated my local working folder into a GitHub Repository, then pushed the local files to the Repository after adding and commiting the updated codes.

Usage

The user must click on Generate Password to generate a randomized password with specified window prompts regarding the user's preference of special characters or style.

The user may select from Special Characters, Lowercase Letters, Uppercase Letters, as well as Numbers.

This web application will provide the end-user the ability to generate a strong randomized password for better security.
