# coding-quiz

Description

This project is for self-improvement and practice in order to provide myself with confidence within this industry.

A Coding Quiz has been created using Google Fonts and the Bootstrap library with features such as:

Timer
High Score Ranking
Initials Input

Installation

To install the project, I've initiated my local working folder into a GitHub Repository, then pushed the local files to the Repository after adding and commiting the updated codes.

To access the project, please enter the Live Page URL found below.

Usage

The user must click on Start the Quiz to begin.

The in-game timer will count down from 100 seconds.

Any correct answers will add time to the clock.

Any incorrect answers will remove time from the clock.

Once the quiz is completed, the user may input their initials to log their high score and try again if they wish.
